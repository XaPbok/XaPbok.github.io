			<p>Let us enjoy reading this Raman Story of Around The Campfire. <br><br>

			Once while traveling, Raman found himself in the company of a group of soldiers. <br><br>

			They were all veterans of war and soon they got to talking about their experiences on the battlefield. One old soldier told of the time he had single-handedly slain seven enemy soldiers. Another gave a detailed description of the manner in which he had held an entire enemy battalion at bay.</p> <br>

			<p>When they had finished they looked condescendingly at Raman. <br><br>

			"I don't suppose you have any adventure worth telling," said one of the grizzled warriors. <br><br>

			"Oh, but I have," said Rama <br><br>

			"You have?!" said the soldiers. <br><br>

			"Yes," said Rama. "Once while traveling I chanced upon a large tent. I entered and there, lying on a mat was the largest man I had ever seen. I recognized him at once as a dreaded dacoit who had been terrorizing that part of the country for years!" </p><br>

			<p>"What did you do?" asked the soldiers, their interest now fully aroused. <br><br>

			"I cut off his toe and ran for dear life," said Rama. <br><br>

			"His toe?" said a soldier. "Why toe? You should have cut off his head while you had the chance!" <br><br>

			"Somebody had already done that," said Rama, grinning. </p> <br>
